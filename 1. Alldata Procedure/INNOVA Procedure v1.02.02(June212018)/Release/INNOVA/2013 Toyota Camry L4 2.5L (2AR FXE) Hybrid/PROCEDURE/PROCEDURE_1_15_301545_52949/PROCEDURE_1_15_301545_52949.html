 <b>15. WHEN INSPECTING VEHICLES</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTICE:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the vehicle is run in inspection mode for an operation such as a speedometer test, a DTC may be set. Therefore, if the warning light comes on, after canceling inspection mode, check for DTCs using the Scan Tool and clear the DTCs.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) VEHICLE CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Before activating inspection mode, turn the air conditioning off, start the hybrid system with shift lever in P, and check that the engine stops within several seconds after starting (engine warm up check).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Activate the appropriate inspection mode and inspect the vehicle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HINT<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Different types of inspection mode are available. One is maintenance mode, and the other is certification mode. The following table indicates the mode appropriate for each test item.<br>

 <b>16. PRECAUTIONS FOR TOWING FRONT WHEEL DRIVE VEHICLES</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Use one of the following methods to tow the vehicle.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) If the vehicle has trouble with the chassis or drivetrain, use method 1 (flatbed truck).<br>
<br>
 <br>
<img src="84_ty12matriA-D103443E06.jpg" width="356" height="391" border = "1"/><br><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTICE:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not use any towing method other than those shown above.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) If a tow truck is not available, in an emergency the vehicle may be temporarily towed using a cable or chain secured to the emergency towing eyelet(s) . This should only be attempted on hard surfaced roads for short distances below 30 km/h (19 mph).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A driver must be in the vehicle to steer and operate the brakes. The vehicle's wheels, drivetrain, axles, steering and brakes must be in good condition.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTICE:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the towing speed or distance exceeds the above limits, or the vehicle is towed in a backward direction with the front wheels on the ground, the transaxle may be damaged.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Emergency towing procedure<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Turn the power switch on (IG).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 Depress the brake pedal and move the shift lever to N.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 Release the parking brake.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 Release the brake pedal slowly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTICE:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Use extreme caution when towing the vehicle. Avoid sudden starts or erratic driving maneuvers which place excessive stress on the emergency towing eyelet and the cables or chains.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * If the hybrid system is off, the power assist for the brakes and steering will not function, making steering and braking more difficult.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Do not turn off the power switch. Turning off the power switch may result in engagement of the steering lock, resulting in a hazardous situation or accident.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) The towing methods shown below are dangerous and can damage the vehicle, so do not use them.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<img src="95_ty12matriA-D104274.jpg" width="356" height="139" border = "1"/><br><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Do not tow the vehicle facing rearward with the front wheels on the ground.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTICE:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * If the vehicle is towed facing rearward with the front wheels on the ground, the drivetrain may overheat and be damaged.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * In addition, if the vehicle is equipped with the VSC system, the system may apply the brakes to the rotating wheels.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Do not use a sling-type towing method either from the front or rear.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTICE:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a sling-type tow truck is used, damage may occur to the vehicle body.<br>
<br>
 <b>17. FOR VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH CATALYTIC CONVERTER</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CAUTION:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a large amount of unburned gasoline or gasoline vapors flow into the converter, it may cause converter overheating and create a fire hazard. To prevent this, observe the following precautions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Use only unleaded gasoline.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Avoid performing unnecessary spark tests.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Perform a spark test only when absolutely necessary. Perform this test as rapidly as possible.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) While testing, never race the engine unless instructed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) Avoid a prolonged engine compression measurement. Engine compression measurements must be performed as rapidly as possible.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) Do not run the engine when the fuel tank is nearly empty. This may cause the engine to misfire and create an extra load on the converter.<br>
