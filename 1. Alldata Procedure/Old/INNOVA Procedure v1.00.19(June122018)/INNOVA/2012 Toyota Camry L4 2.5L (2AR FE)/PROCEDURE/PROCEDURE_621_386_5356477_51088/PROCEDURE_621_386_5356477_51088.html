<h1>2AR-FE ENGINE CONTROL: SFI SYSTEM: READINESS MONITOR DRIVE PATTERN</h1><br>
<br>
 <b>1. PURPOSE OF READINESS TESTS</b><br>
<br>
 * The On-Board Diagnostic (OBD II) system is designed to monitor the performance of emission related components, and indicate any detected abnormalities using DTCs (Diagnostic Trouble Codes). Since various components need to be monitored during different driving conditions, the OBD II system is designed to run separate monitoring programs called Readiness Monitors.<br>
<br>
 * To view the status, enter the following menus: Powertrain / Engine and ECT / Monitor / Current Monitor / Current.<br>
<br>
 * When the status of a Readiness Monitor reads Complete, the necessary conditions have been met for running the performance tests for that Readiness Monitor.<br>
<br>
 * A generic OBD II scan tool can also be used to view the Readiness Monitor status.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HINT<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many state Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) programs require the status of vehicle Readiness Monitor to show Complete before beginning emission tests.<br>
<br>
 * The Readiness Monitor is reset to Incomplete if:<br>
<br>
 * The ECM has lost battery power or blown a fuse.<br>
<br>
 * DTCs have been cleared.<br>
<br>
 * The conditions for running the Readiness Monitor have not been met.<br>
<br>
 * If the Readiness Monitor status shows Incomplete, follow the appropriate Readiness Monitor Drive Pattern to change the status to Complete.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CAUTION:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strictly observe posted speed limits, traffic laws, and road conditions when performing these drive patterns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTICE:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These drive patterns represent the fastest method of satisfying all conditions necessary to achieve complete status for each specific Readiness Monitor.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event of a drive pattern being interrupted (possibly due to factors such as traffic conditions), the drive pattern can be resumed. In most cases, the Readiness Monitor will still achieve complete status upon completion of the drive pattern.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure completion of the Readiness Monitors, avoid sudden changes in vehicle load and speed (driving up and down hills and/or sudden acceleration).<br>
