<h1>2AR-FE ENGINE CONTROL: SFI SYSTEM: CHECKING MONITOR STATUS</h1><br>
<br>
The purpose of the monitor result (mode 06) is to allow access to the results of on-board diagnostic monitoring tests of specific components/systems that are not continuously monitored. Examples are catalysts and evaporative emissions (EVAP) systems.<br>
<br>
The monitor result allows the OBD II scan tool to display the monitor status, test value, minimum test limit and maximum test limit. These data are displayed after the vehicle has been driven to run the monitor.<br>
<br>
When the test value is not between the minimum and maximum test limits, the ECM (PCM) interprets this as a malfunction. If the test value is on the borderline of the test limits, the component is likely to malfunction in the near future.<br>
<br>
Perform the following procedures to view the monitor status. Although these procedures refer to the Lexus/Toyota Scan Tool, the monitor status can be checked using a generic OBD II scan tool. Refer to your scan tool operator's manual for specific procedural information.<br>
<br>
 <b>1. PERFORM MONITOR DRIVE PATTERN</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)Connect the Scan Tool to the DLC3.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)Turn the ignition switch to ON and turn the Scan Tool on.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)Clear the DTCs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)Operate the vehicle in accordance with the applicable drive pattern described in Readiness Monitor Drive Pattern&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . Do not turn the ignition switch off.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTICE:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The test results will be lost if the ignition switch is turned off.<br>
<br>
 <b>2. ACCESS MONITOR RESULT</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)Enter the following menus: Powertrain / Engine and ECT / Monitor / Current Monitor / Result.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)Confirm the monitor status for each component.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HINT<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The monitor status for each component is displayed in the Result column.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Pass: The component is functioning normally.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Fail: The component is malfunctioning.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)Display the test results and test values for a monitor by selecting the icon in the Details column for that monitor.<br>
<br>
 <b>3. CHECK COMPONENT STATUS</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)Compare the test value with the minimum test limit (Min Limit) and maximum test limit (Max Limit).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)If the test value is between the minimum and maximum test limits, the component is functioning normally. If not, the component is malfunctioning. The test value is usually not near the test limits. If the test value is on the borderline of the test limits, the component is likely to malfunction in the near future.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HINT<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The monitor result might on rare occasions be Pass even if the Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) is illuminated. This indicates the system malfunctioned on a previous driving cycle. This might be caused by an intermittent problem.<br>
<br>
 <b>4. MONITOR RESULT INFORMATION</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When using a generic scan tool, multiply the test value by the scaling value.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refer to "Monitor Result" in each DTC related to the monitor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
